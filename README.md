## Feature Breakdown

This section details the main features of the AirBnB Clone backend, highlighting their role in delivering a robust and user-friendly platform. Each feature is designed to mimic core Airbnb functionalities while ensuring scalability and performance.

- **User Management**
  - This feature enables secure user registration, authentication, and profile management through dedicated endpoints like `/users/`. It contributes to the project by providing a foundation for personalized experiences and secure access, essential for user trust and engagement.

- **Property Management**
  - Property management allows users to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings via endpoints such as `/properties/`. It supports the project by enabling hosts to showcase their offerings effectively, driving the platform's core rental business model.

- **Booking System**
  - The booking system facilitates the creation and management of reservations with endpoints like `/bookings/`, including check-in and check-out details. It enhances the project by streamlining the rental process for users, ensuring a seamless experience from selection to confirmation.

- **Payment Processing**
  - This feature handles payment transactions through the `/payments/` endpoint, recording details for bookings. It contributes to the project by providing a secure and efficient transaction system, crucial for the financial integrity and user satisfaction of the platform.

- **Review System**
  - The review system allows users to post and manage reviews via `/reviews/`, including ratings and comments. It supports the project by fostering trust and transparency among users through community feedback, influencing property popularity and user decisions.

## API Security

This section details the key security measures implemented to safeguard the AirBnB Clone backend APIs, ensuring a secure and trustworthy platform for users and hosts. These measures protect sensitive data and transactions, aligning with the project's focus on secure user interactions and payment processing.

- **Authentication**
  - **Measure**: Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JSON Web Tokens) via Django REST Framework to verify user identities on endpoints like `/users/` and `/bookings/`.
  - **Importance**: Authentication is crucial for protecting user data by ensuring only authorized individuals can access or modify their profiles and bookings, preventing unauthorized access and identity theft.

- **Authorization**
  - **Measure**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., hosts can manage properties, users can book), enforced through middleware or permissions in Django.
  - **Importance**: Authorization secures property management and payment processing by limiting actions to appropriate users, reducing the risk of data tampering or fraudulent activities.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - **Measure**: Apply rate limiting using Django REST Framework's throttling to restrict the number of API requests (e.g., 100 requests per hour per user) on endpoints like `/payments/` and `/reviews/`.
  - **Importance**: Rate limiting is essential for securing payments and review systems by mitigating brute-force attacks and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attempts, ensuring system availability and integrity.

- **Data Encryption**
  - **Measure**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user passwords, payment details) in transit with HTTPS and at rest using PostgreSQL encryption features.
  - **Importance**: Data encryption is vital for protecting user data and payments, safeguarding personal and financial information from interception or breaches during storage and transmission.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**
  - **Measure**: Implement input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints (e.g., `/properties/`, `/reviews/`) to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection or XSS.
  - **Importance**: This measure is critical for the review system and property management, ensuring malicious code cannot compromise the database or user experience, maintaining platform reliability.

These security measures address the project's core areas—user management, property management, booking systems, payment processing, and reviews—by mitigating risks and building trust with users.
