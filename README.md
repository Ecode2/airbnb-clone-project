# ALX Airbnb-Clone-Project
Air BnB clone for ALX ProDev Course



## Team Roles
- Backend Developer:
The Backend Developer is responsible for designing and implementing the core server-side logic of the Airbnb Clone. This includes creating and managing API endpoints (e.g., /users/, /properties/) using Django and Django REST Framework, integrating GraphQL for flexible data queries, and implementing business logic for user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. They also contribute to feature-driven development, ensuring robust functionality like payment processing and review systems, and handle API security fundamentals to protect user data.
- Database Administrator (DBA):
The DBA manages the design, implementation, and optimization of the PostgreSQL database. Their responsibilities include planning the relational database structure with entities (e.g., users, properties, bookings), defining attributes and relationships, and applying optimizations such as indexing and caching with Redis. They ensure efficient data retrieval, storage, and scalability, aligning with the "Database Optimizations" goal to support the application's performance needs.
- DevOps Engineer:
The DevOps Engineer oversees the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services. They set up Docker containers for consistent development and deployment environments, configure CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment, and integrate tools like Celery for asynchronous tasks (e.g., notifications, payment processing). Their role ensures the backend remains efficient, reliable, and scalable, supporting the project's deployment phase.
- QA Engineer:
The QA Engineer ensures the backend functionalities meet quality standards through thorough testing. They validate API endpoints (e.g., CRUD operations for users, properties, bookings), verify payment processing and review system workflows, and test database optimizations like indexing and caching. Their work aligns with the project's goal of minimizing errors during the CI/CD pipeline integration, ensuring a seamless user experience.


## Technology Stack

This project leverages a robust and scalable technology stack to build the backend for the AirBnB Clone. Below is an overview of the technologies used and their specific roles:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API, providing a structured and efficient foundation for handling backend logic and routing.
- **Django REST Framework**: An extension of Django that provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs, enabling CRUD operations for user and property data.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for storing and managing data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, and reviews with high reliability and performance.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that offers a flexible and efficient mechanism for retrieving and manipulating data, enhancing the backend's query capabilities.
- **Celery**: A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous tasks, such as sending notifications or processing payments, to improve application responsiveness.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used for caching and session management, reducing database load and boosting performance.
- **Docker**: A containerization tool that ensures consistent development and deployment environments across different stages of the project.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines integrated to test and deploy code changes, minimizing errors and enhancing development efficiency.
